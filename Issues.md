Overall, this project is coming together but some issues, especially
with the first implementation of our code arose.

When creating the html file for our base map, the platform we were using
(VSCODE) struggled to save the save and push new data to our repository.
When a group member attempted to do so, an error was thrown stating a 
lack of permission to push the new data. Eventually we discover not all 
group members had accepted the invite to our repository. This error
was eventually resolved by sending a zip file of the data to another 
member and them pushing the data.

We had another issue with getting one of our charts to load. Each time 
a group member attempted to do so, a 404 error was displayed on the 
web page. 

When creating our chart, our group also struggled to display our isolated 
data from the dataset. Instead every data point was being included in our
chart resulting is a messy display. Progress is being made, however, our
chart is still not finalized. 

Finally, our group struggled with creating our smart dashboard. We ran 
into issues with getting the elements of the dashboard to interact with 
our map. More work needs to be done to remedy this.
