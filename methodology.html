        <h2>Functions of our Web Map</h2>
        <p>For our projectâ€™s functions we created an interactive web map that will allow the user to switch between rural and urban food desert areas as we want to separate the two for more clarity due to them being different areas of interest. Furthermore, we created an option that will allow the user to pick a given distance that the map will use to show store proximity. For example, selecting 3 miles would display areas within a 3 mile distance to the nearest food store.</p>
        <p>Another function we added is a filter that will allow the user to filter by state so that they can get a closer look at their area of interest. We added a pop-up window for supplemental information like poverty rates or number food banks when a user clicks on a county/state.
        <h2>How Our Project Works</h2>
        <p>Our map uses <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844">Open Street Map</a> to display the results for our project, using data from the UDSA we are able to map areas that have low access to food supply based on the distance and availability of grocery stores from residential housing.
        Shapefiles are used to set boundaries of the map and to aggregate the data via county, state, or any other format selected by the user.</p>
        <p>A complete list of our datasets and sources can be found in the <a href="https://swierj.github.io/food_deserts_america/credits.html">credits page</a>.</p>
