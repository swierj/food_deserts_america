        <h2>What is a Food Desert?</h2>
        <p>A “food desert” generally refers to an area where the population has limited access to fresh and healthy food. In this project, we want to explore spatial distribution of the food deserts in the U.S. and illustrate how the accessibility of transportation, below poverty population are in relation with the accessibility of fresh and healthy food.
        A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDbENx9c3Fg">short video</a> from Vice news helps explain in detail about a food desert in New York City</p>
        <p>Food Deserts are not limited to poor or rural areas, they can occur anywhere where affordability is an issue as a result of discrimination, racism, or cultural ignorance. Areas that do not provide healthy options and are limited to fast food franchises are considered food deserts as they are unable to provide options for residents to eat.</p>
        <h2>Functions of our Web Map</h2>
        <p>For our project’s functions we created an interactive web map that will allow the user to switch between rural and urban food desert areas as we want to separate the two for more clarity due to them being different areas of interest. Furthermore, we created an option that will allow the user to pick a given distance that the map will use to show store proximity. For example, selecting 3 miles would display areas within a 3 mile distance to the nearest food store.</p>
        <p>Another function we added is a filter that will allow the user to filter by state so that they can get a closer look at their area of interest. We added a pop-up window for supplemental information like poverty rates or number food banks when a user clicks on a county/state.
        <h2>How Our Project Works</h2>
        <p>Our map uses <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844">Open Street Map</a> to display the results for our project, using data from the UDSA we are able to map areas that have low access to food supply based on the distance and availability of grocery stores from residential housing.
        Shapefiles are used to set boundaries of the map and to aggregate the data via county, state, or any other format selected by the user.</p>
        <p>A complete list of our datasets and sources can be found in the <a href="https://swierj.github.io/food_deserts_america/credits.html">credits page</a>.</p>
