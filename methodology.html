    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <h2>What is a Food Desert?</h2>
    <p>A “food desert” generally refers to an area where the population has limited access to fresh and healthy food. In this project, we want to explore spatial distribution of the food deserts in the U.S. and illustrate how the accessibility of transportation, below poverty population are in relation with the accessibility of fresh and healthy food.
    A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDbENx9c3Fg">short video</a> from Vice news helps explain in detail about a food desert in New York City</p>
    <h2>Functions of our Web Map</h2>
    <p>For our project’s functions we created an interactive web map that will allow the user to switch between rural and urban food desert areas as we want to separate the two for more clarity due to them being different areas of interest. Furthermore, we created an option that will allow the user to pick a given distance that the map will use to show store proximity. For example, selecting 3 miles would display areas within a 3 mile distance to the nearest food store. Another function we added is a filter that will allow the user to filter by state so that they can get a closer look at their area of interest. Lastly we added a pop-up window for supplemental information like poverty rates or number food banks when a user clicks on a county/state.
    For our project’s multimedia, we found a . This example discusses how fast food chains are the main, and sometimes the only food source options in many neighborhoods composed predominantly of people of color. In addition, the video documents the community actions being taken, such as neighborhood gardens, to rectify the lack of nutrient rich foods in the area. This video was also chosen to exemplify the fact ‘food deserts’ are not a 3rd world problem nor do they only occur in rural areas.
    Next, we chose a flowchart depicting the relationships between various factors from personal behavior to governmental limitations all of which lead to the prominence of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK208027/figure/mmm00011/?report=objectonly">food deserts</a>.</p>
